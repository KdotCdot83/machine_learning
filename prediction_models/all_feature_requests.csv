160756,Adisa,8/1/17,edit drive details,"Hi MileIQ,

 

How does MileIQ account for commute mileage in the following situation:

 

Let‚Äôs assume your assigned office is 14 miles north of your home.

Then let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre going to make a customer visit, first thing in the morning that‚Äôs 65 miles south of your home, 79 miles from the office.

You leave from home and go to the customer‚Äôs location. According to IRS rules, you must deduct the 14 normal daily commute miles from the 65 miles meaning for that trip, you are allowed a deduction of 51 miles.

 

If you identify the miles as business, it appears that MileIQ will identify all 65 miles as business ‚Äì which would be in violation of IRS rules.

If you identify the miles as personal, then you lose 51 miles of allowable deduction.

 

Is there a way to configure MileIQ so that it automatically accounts for the daily commute miles, both going to work and returning home?

 

Thanks,
Frank

161159,Danijela,8/1/17,other ways to classify,"Still finding it kind of hard to classify everything. Wish this app were a little more user friendly (UX / site architecture) and easier to classify: 
Ex: 
Telling the app not to ask to auto-classify repeatedly (there's a big intersection I go to for various reasons - sometimes business sometimes personal) but the app constantly asks me to auto classify and I have to keep saying no. 

Ex: an extra button or icon to classify thebdrive instead of a half or full swipe. Find it very difficult to do what I want to do here to classify or not. A button at the bottom of the window would be easier. 

A ding reminder to classify drives. I usually go months before classifying because I keep forgetting or am on the phone. Would classify if I was able to classify by voice recording / something like Siri."
161287,Tiffany,8/1/17,other,"Hello My name is Joshua 
Please read my entire email.
I own a semi truck and operate mostly in Portland Oregon and Vancouver Washington  I have a problem I and many truck drivers in these 2 boarder cities have the problems with tracking mileage hopefully I can clearly explain.

As a Independent truck owner I pay extended taxes and fees for using the roads in several ways.

1st is HVUT, ‚ÄúHeavy Vehicle Use Tax‚Äù usually it‚Äôs a flat federal tax based on the weight of the loads moved not really important here.

2nd IFTA, ‚Äú International Fuel Tax Agreement‚Äù this is a tax that is paid based on the ‚Äúnumber of miles‚Äù and the number of ‚Äúgallons of fuel bought‚Äù
When I report to IFTA I report   
How many miles I traveled in each state its divided in to 2, taxed miles and untaxed miles aka off road private property.
I also have to report how many gallons of diesel I bought and what state 

At this point there are dozens and dozens of sites that do IFTA reporting 

‚ÄúBUTT‚Äù here is my real problem. My base state is Oregon most of my mileage is Oregon and Oregon does things differently if you own a trucking company there are 2 states everyone avoids Oregon and California. 

As a Oregon based truck I pay road use tax outside IFTA and HVUT, I pay a 3rd called ‚ÄúOregon Weight Mile Tax‚Äù

When I report Oregon Weight Mile Tax I report 

1st How many Miles I drove
2nd number of axels   
3rd declared weight 

Declared empty weight of 46,000 any # of axels = 0.0726 charge per mile //  0.0726 x 1787miles = 129.74 owed to Oregon 
Declared weight of 80,000 and 5 axels = 0.1638 charge per mile // 0.1638 x 1787miles = 292.71
Declared weight of 96,000 and 6 axels = 0.1836 charge per mile // 

Basically a Oregon base truck can have 7 declared axle and weight arrangements. It would be nice and save me tons of hours to be able to categorize these trips as they happen I usually use all seven declared  arrangements every month and it takes an entire weekend to do month ending today I am doing July.

There is no current product that figures Oregon weight mile tax for Oregon based trucks

162155,Tiffany,8/1/17,edit drive details,"Hello, I just wanted to share that I find two things very frustrating about the MileIQ Android app:
1. There's no way to edit a drive's start or end locations or times. So if MileIQ doesn't get this quite right, I can't do anything with the drive until I get to a computer, and I have to remember to fix it on the web dashboard.
2. The same is true if MileIQ misses a drive - there's no way to manually add one within the app.
3. Lastly, there's no way to view and edit drives that are already classified. If I'm going through my drives and classifying several, and realize I've made a mistake with one, I again have to go to the web dashboard to fix it (unless it's the very last one I classified, in which case I can undo).

These limitations seem strange and, again, are frustrating."

I was wondering if you all have considered integrating with zapier?  It would be great to send triggers based on arrivals and departures from different locations.  That have a developer site for it. https://zapier.com/developer/

Also, I was wondering if there is a way to stop the app from highlighting the top of my iPhone blue. I already know its tracking me, but the blue status bar at the top is causing the screen to move items down and off the screen similar to when you are on a phone call, only of it is green at that time, of course. Lastly, can we have a feature to clarify which client we were visiting during a trip? I live in Chicago so I label my trips and sometimes clients are only a block or two apart and it will automatically say i'm at a different client than where I actually am.

Thanks!

For this reason, it would be nice to be able to click and drop a point where to start or stop, like you can in Google Maps. This helps if I forgot to turn on my location and have to manually add something. I end up missing some miles sometimes because the nearest ""address"" isnt actually where I went. thanks for taking the time to read this.

168814,Quesonya,9/1/17,expenses,"Mileiq,

I have been happy with your app and it is saving me lots of money. Both my wife and I make use of your app for keeping track of our business mileage.

That being said, there are two areas that could use improvement. The first is with tolls. I frequently use a local toll road (E-470) and recording the tolls, both booth and exit tolls, is time consuming and prone to errors. I hadn't thought about tolls much until I started driving for Uber, and the Uber app records tolls automatically.

Second, mileiq is good for point to point trips, but when I am driving for Uber, sometimes I will never stop long enough to record separate trips, but I may be driving for over 6 hours. I have recorded mileage in the 200 mile range, but the app only recorded 125 miles. These circuitous non-stop trips could use improvement.

I was wondering if you are planning to introduce a new feature of MileIQ:

 

I was thinking it would be great to have the option for MileIQ to ask do you have blootooth in your car.

If answer is YES it could ask what is name of blootooth in your car and once selected MileIQ could force location sync as soon as device is connected to the blootooth and again once disconnected.

 

Option to add additional bloototh devices would be great as some people may be using personal & company car.

 

I think this would give much better accuracy of data.

 I am an app worker and a delivery driver and I have noticed that often when I make delivery I don't seem to be stopped long enough for the app to register this as a complete drive.  

While I'm working this isn't a huge problem because I'm **normally** busy enough that my next drive is also for business and connection the to drives isn't a problem.  

This is a *huge* problem at the end of my shift.  Like right now.  Instead of leaving to go grab something to eat during my short break I'm sitting here waiting for the app to decide that I've stopped long enough for my drive to end.  
Since my work schedule is very variable I can't just put in my hours and let the app autoclassify.  
I like that the app Auto logs in case I forget.  I would also like to be able to manually end a drive.  Because I'm hungry and I wrote almost this whole email before getting an alert for this drive.

Thank You For Upgrading

Hi goodman.enterprise,
Thank you for subscribing to MileIQ - we're thrilled to have you as a customer.
To make sure you're set up to get the most out of MileIQ too, I've asked our customer success team to share their best advice for new customers.
Here are some of their top tips:

""Get into a routine for classifying your drives. Some users do it whenever they have a free moment (like waiting in line at the grocery store!). Others make it part of their end-of-day routine or spend a few minutes each Monday when they get their weekly drive report. Find the rhythm that works for you."" - Lisa C.

""Use notes and custom purposes to categorize your drives in ways that are relevant to your business. You can report on a group of these drives by going to your MileIQ dashboard, doing a keyword search (say, for a client or project name you've added to the notes) and clicking the ‚ÄòReport drives' button."" - Katie M.

""Don't forget about our help center! You can access it 24/7 to find instant answers to lots of questions and how-to guides for all the key features. Go to Help > FAQ & Feedback in the MileIQ app or visit support.mileiq.com (http://go.mileiq.com/lnk/AEMAQrmQm_EAAATkxmkAAAXs4L4AAAAHs5kAAAAAAAYDCgBZyk9_8MiDAC_oRrOW3GqqzQBVBQAFwjo/1/oj33KlkBsMcAUWI8ETpfUQ/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXNoYm9hcmQubWlsZWlxLmNvbS9yb3V0ZTI_d1JvdXRlPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3VwcG9ydC5taWxlaXEuY29tJmFsbFBhcmFtcz1zb3VyY2UlM0RlbWFpbCUyNmNhbXBhaWduJTNEVXBncmFkZUFja25vd2xlZGdlbWVudCUyNnNwZWNzJTNEVXBncmFkZUFja25vd2xlZGdlbWVudF90aXBfc3VwcG9ydCUyNnVzZXJJZCUzRGRJTVRsS0g0RWVlSmNnTGlTQnNJLXc) ."" - Melissa S.

not necessary for basic function of the system to work.  I want it
turned off."
174079,Tiffany,9/1/17,integration,"I've been a subscriber for a couple of years now but I have been sorely disappointed by the lack of advancement with the service. I have multiple vehicles that I drive on a regular basis and multiple jobs. I have found that while the app does a fine job of tracking drives that is literally the extent of its usefulness which makes it really not very useful. The technology built in to smartphones today (especially the iPhone) should allow a developer to build an app such as this one that can auto-detect not only that a drive is being taken but also which vehicle is being driven. Something as simple as a bluetooth beacon placed in the vehicle would make this easy to do. Without the app determining which vehicle I'm driving I'm faced with a literal mountain of data that piles up very, very quickly. If I can't stay on top of it, classifying drives and assigning vehicles, on a daily basis then I'm left to guess later what each drive was for or, more likely, just disregard the entire system and revert back to generic odometer readings from the beginning and end of each year. I paid for the subscription to your service because I could see the benefits but without adding the ability of the app to help just a little bit more I will not be renewing again. I made this suggestion over a year ago and it has still not been implemented. I cannot believe that I'm the only customer of yours with this desire. I figured that I'd provide this easy to implement tip to you and then you'd be able to run with it and even expand your business and profitability by selling hardware beacons to your customers who, like me, have multiple vehicles. I would buy at least 5 beacons myself.

Sorry for the rant. I just took a look at my dashboard and realized how far behind I am on classifying drives and I'm just giving up. I really would like for the app and this service to be useful but in its current state it just isn't so I feel like I'm wasting my money.

Sincerly,

Your MileIQ app is great. It would be fantastic if you could expand your product offerings to include an app that would ""nag"" the user to confirm what they are working on, for whom and is it billable time.

Perhaps with a time window (M-F, 6am-6pm) - I know I'd find value in it, and pay for the app less than $300.  I'm sure I waste or lose at least that amount every month because of my poor recordkeeping.

Thanks for MileIQ - let me know when/if you expand your product line.

Welcome!

Hi simplyconsultant,

We‚Äôre delighted that you‚Äôve signed up! We created MileIQ to relieve the hassle of mileage tracking so you can focus on the things you care about most. Getting started is easy:

Drive

MileIQ automatically logs every drive as long as you‚Äôre signed in‚Äîno need to press a button or start recording!

Classify

A drive ‚Äúcard‚Äù will appear in the MileIQ app a short time after you reach your destination‚Äîswipe it to ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù or ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù or choose a more specific purpose.

Repeat

And watch the miles‚Äîand dollars‚Äîadd up!

Then watch your inbox for weekly and monthly drive summaries. You‚Äôll see how easy it is to keep complete, accurate mileage records when MileIQ is automatically logging every drive for you.

You can also personalize MileIQ by naming locations (http://go.mileiq.com/lnk/AEAAR2qOCkMAAATpFOQAAAXubfAAAAAHs5kAAAAAAAYDCgBZ5YRYktEAUY9WSzST75rfpmdWgwAFwjo/1/yW9xTjgZGfuIQh4sCD-0hw/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXNoYm9hcmQubWlsZWlxLmNvbS9yb3V0ZTI_d1JvdXRlPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3VwcG9ydC5taWxlaXEuY29tJTJGaGMlMkZlbi11cyUyRmFydGljbGVzJTJGMjA0NDc1OTA1JmFsbFBhcmFtcz1zb3VyY2UlM0RlbWFpbCUyNmNhbXBhaWduJTNEV2VsY29tZSUyNnNwZWNzJTNEV2VsY29tZV9zdXBwb3J0X2xvY2F0aW9ucyUyNnVzZXJJZCUzREVvbVB0TEx5RWVlcloycGMxWWpXWkE) , managing vehicles (http://go.mileiq.com/lnk/AEAAR2qOCkMAAATpFOQAAAXubfAAAAAHs5kAAAAAAAYDCgBZ5YRYktEAUY9WSzST75rfpmdWgwAFwjo/2/rIn4Bv6Y442McbqQQoDKpA/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXNoYm9hcmQubWlsZWlxLmNvbS9yb3V0ZTI_d1JvdXRlPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3VwcG9ydC5taWxlaXEuY29tJTJGaGMlMkZlbi11cyUyRmFydGljbGVzJTJGMjA1MTQ0MjU1JmFsbFBhcmFtcz1zb3VyY2UlM0RlbWFpbCUyNmNhbXBhaWduJTNEV2VsY29tZSUyNnNwZWNzJTNEV2VsY29tZV9zdXBwb3J0X3ZlaGljbGVzJTI2dXNlcklkJTNERW9tUHRMTHlFZWVyWjJwYzFZaldaQQ) , specifying work hours (http://go.mileiq.com/lnk/AEAAR2qOCkMAAATpFOQAAAXubfAAAAAHs5kAAAAAAAYDCgBZ5YRYktEAUY9WSzST75rfpmdWgwAFwjo/3/fZRF0HoVRSkDZRz2ci42FQ/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXNoYm9hcmQubWlsZWlxLmNvbS9yb3V0ZTI_d1JvdXRlPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3VwcG9ydC5taWxlaXEuY29tJTJGaGMlMkZlbi11cyUyRmFydGljbGVzJTJGMjAzNzk4ODk5JmFsbFBhcmFtcz1zb3VyY2UlM0RlbWFpbCUyNmNhbXBhaWduJTNEV2VsY29tZSUyNnNwZWNzJTNEV2VsY29tZV9zdXBwb3J0X3dvcmtob3VycyUyNnVzZXJJZCUzREVvbVB0TEx5RWVlcloycGMxWWpXWkE) , creating custom purposes (http://go.mileiq.com/lnk/AEAAR2qOCkMAAATpFOQAAAXubfAAAAAHs5kAAAAAAAYDCgBZ5YRYktEAUY9WSzST75rfpmdWgwAFwjo/4/KeidQvWviqlvqgJgRFS-Ag/aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXNoYm9hcmQubWlsZWlxLmNvbS9yb3V0ZTI_d1JvdXRlPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGc3VwcG9ydC5taWxlaXEuY29tJTJGaGMlMkZlbi11cyUyRmFydGljbGVzJTJGMjA0NDc1OTE1JmFsbFBhcmFtcz1zb3VyY2UlM0RlbWFpbCUyNmNhbXBhaWduJTNEV2VsY29tZSUyNnNwZWNzJTNEV2VsY29tZV9zdXBwb3J0X3B1cnBvc2VzJTI2dXNlcklkJTNERW9tUHRMTHlFZWVyWjJwYzFZaldaQQ) , and much, much more.

You‚Äôve hit your free 40-drive limit for the month

If you‚Äôre seeing fewer drives than expected, that‚Äôs likely why. If you want to start catching drives again right away ‚Äî and make sure you capture every mile going forward ‚Äî upgrade to an unlimited-drive plan for just $5.99/mo or $59.99/yr. Don't forget, MileIQ pays for itself in less than 20 business miles a month.

When labeling the destination or starting point, autofill from previous places would be pretty convenient and could help improve report accuracy.

There's currently no way to change the vehicle tagged in a trip that was auto-classified without using a computer. Having editing access to the past few trips would be very helpful as I sometimes forget to change my primary vehicle before leaving for a house call.

I know your focus is probably enterprize only, as that's where the money is at for this kind of application.

Ever considered something for personal usage? Not sure if that's possible since business users could then avoid the fees. Note: I use to use an old app called PlaceMe that is no longer around. I liked the idea of being aware of when/where I had traveled as a reference, despite rarely using it.

Over time, I realize that all the various digital accounts I sign up for push my monthly spend, and (as a consumer) there is a propensity to purchase some of the lower priced services/apps without question, whereas even something in the $10 a month range starts to be positioned as an unnecessary increase.

Just some perspective though I realize your business is geared towards enterprize users for which your price point is set correctly.

Is it possible to sync a calendar and then have MileIQ automatically track drives that coincide with that schedule? My side-business schedule isn't predictable and I'mnitrile about turning on the app specifically for work drives. I've considered the upgrade so tracking is unlimited, I also don't want to spend a lot of time categorizing 95%+ of my drives as ""personal"". If I could use a calendar, I'd be more than happy to upgrade to the paid version.

2.) there should be a setting that allows the app to automatically restart of the phone restarts. I shouldn't have to reopen the app.  Sometimes people's batteries die or the phone crashes and resets. Etc. 

2.) you should be able to add a customized purpose directly. Shouldn't have to change windows. Wen you go to add a purpose, right there you should be able to add a customized purpose there.

186436,Adisa,11/1/17,other ways to classify,"I drive multiple route stops, one after the other, sometimes as many as 30 throughout the day. Often the app currently combines the stops and reports several several stops as on route. Sometimes, the report separates the rotues.

For my purpose, it doesnt matter to me that each route be separately identified in the app. What is important, however, is that I know the amount of business miles I have driven for the day. There are no personal stops during the day, so there would be no need to identify personal drives during normal business hours. 

My suggestion is simple. Instead of me receiving inacurrate beginning and ending drive descriptions, why dont you provide a feature to be able to combine manually start and stop the drive tracking and to provide an option to report multiple trips. In my case, I would turn on the app before I begin my work and then turn off the app when Im finished working. Therefore, all I would see is one daily business report that shows my beginning and end locations. If I start and stop from the same location, but drive 100 miles, I would see a report showing the beginning and end location being the same with 100 miles being reported.

And, if were to make any petsonal drives, I would have the ability stop the app and at a later
time to resume the business mileage reporting."

187005,Sabrina,11/1/17,ideas to improve algorithm,"Hi all,

First of all, thanks for a great app!

Second of all, I have a suggestion for how it could be better. I'm someone who drives to work about 40% of the time, and commutes via public transit the rest of the time. While MileIQ definitely saves me time logging business drives, I actually find it frustrating how much time I have to spend each week deleting my public transit routes. If your software is smart enough to
""learn"" when a drive is usually Personal or Business, it seems like it shouldn't be too hard for it to learn that a certain route is via public transit. 

Whaddaya say? Perhaps this feature is already in the works?

Thank you again!

I need to be able to edit any property of any trip and have a consistent set of editing tools across both the web interface and the smartphone app.

 

I need to be able to edit the following trip properties, regardless of whether the trip has already been classified:

 

1. Start location

2. Start location departure time

3. Intermediate locations (waypoints)

4. Intermediate location arrival / departure time

5. Destination location

6. Destination location arrival time

7. Notes for each trip and any segments that comprise it.

 

My experience with MileIQ is that the editing features change depending on whether the trip has already been classified and the editing tools differ between the web interface and the mobile app. This experience was my reason for giving MileIQ a low review.

188774,Adisa,11/1/17,expenses,"FEATURE SUGGESTION
============================
I absolutely love the app. I am hoping that you continue to expand functionality as you are with the auto classifications.

Another great feature would be to have the ability to add on trip costs. Since I believe most of the users use this in relationship to taxes, the ability to add a photo of receipts or a reminder at locations would be really helpful to later extract business related expenses. 

Going a step further, having a reminder prompt optionally pop up for locations such as gas stations/restaurants would be ideal. 

Also, the auto classify for work is awesome, but does it auto categorize drives based on similarity of begin/end points or something else? It would be great to set it as optionally classified by an end point or beginning point 

I work a day job as software QA but also contract during the evening and weekends for tech installs so having location based classifications or even linking through to google/ms API for maps/calendar would be amazing. Additionally having triggers from other API would be useful for prompts to add events. 

===============================
One thought is that mileiq is somewhat of a 'one trick pony' so to speak. It's an amazingly novel and incredibly well executed trick. I don't mean to say that insultingly and I understand the value of modularity and continuing to improve the single focus at hand. 

But I also think it would be amazing to add anticipated drives. I would imagine this could easily be recognized by users for business trips both for fulfillment of business needs, both time sensitive and otherwise.

eg Adding a future drive of 'Get printer from PrintShop+' could allow me to map how long a drive would take, upload a photo of the printer i need, then after the trip I would be prompted for a receipt upload. 

I wouldn't want mileIQ to try and take on perfecting to-do lists, but unless users already have a specified app to upload receipts to, it would be great juxtaposition that stays in line with the novelty of business needs/ travel/ recording expenses. 

Sorry for the incredibly long note, but I really enjoy your product and tend to QA things I love because it's obvious your company intends to make a wonderful product. 

Thanks and take care,

Michael

Swiping - left or right - to classify drives is too sensitive. It is far too easy to swipe too hard and the drive is just registered as unclassified.  Most apps require an aggressive swipe to function at all and yours is the opposite. I do not suggest needing an aggressive swipe but a swipe and bounce back and further swipe before a drive is unclassified.

191492,Quesonya,11/1/17,show route,"Would be better if it showed the travel path not just the starting and ending point. Sometimes if I am running errands, it doesn't log the stops, and just shows my starting ending point at home. Not helpful when I need to know where I've been. Also doesn't seem to record every drive, sometimes only recording one direction."
191511,Tiffany,11/1/17,start/stop,Please add an option to add a stop (do not direct me to add a drive option. I am very familiar with this very time consuming process) or split a drive! Having to manually add hundreds of stops every year is a huge burden. I feel like for an app I pay for I should be able to get this task completed quickly but instead I am having to rely on Google Maps Timeline to help me create new drives in this system and it takes days to complete my yearly milage report. I have been paying for this app for almost 2 years and I if this option is not offered soon I am just going to use the paper method and Google Timeline because it is actually less work than manually adding drives to this system. 
191768,Sabrina,12/1/17,start/stop,You need a push button for start and stop of a trip . I do not leave location on all the time except when driving . Sometimes your app picks up my movement long after I've already left my departure point Also wants me to leave on location long time after I'm already at my destination. Often difficult if stopping to eat on a business travel To link it as a single trip

191970,Kiara,12/1/17,vehicle management,"Hello.  Here is my idea in 2 parts.  Be able to tie the bluetooth device connected to the vehicle you are using.  Since most cars are coming with Bluetooth connected sound systems, it would be nice to have MileIQ automatically determine which vehicle you are in based upon what bluetooth device you are connected to.

2nd part.  Make a simple bluetooth or other device for those vehicles that dont have bluetooth sound systems to help automatically determine which vehicle you are in.

192328,Quesonya,12/1/17,start/stop,"Hello.
Could it be made possible to STOP a detected drive somewhere. It would be useful, as the drive detection sometimes takes a long time to catch up, meanwhile, if there would be a STOP button, this would not be necessary. Equally, if this is not possible, would it be possible to edit a drive, so this can be adjusted to a Business/Personal part, much like it possible to edit waypoints after a run, with a GPS watch, as the MileIQ app takes a long time to catch up, it is a bit ridiculous to have to park somewhere to make the drive a legitimate business drive, after which you can continue. Both the mentioned features would benefit the app. thank you for your help in advance. regards,

admittedly, I am not diligent about reviewing my mileage on a daily or regular basis.

When I do analyze my mileage activity, it tends to be for blocks of time.

I may create several reports related to business, personal, medical and other needs.

After creating reports, I click on the pdf button to view the report before I decide to save or make corrections.  When I click on the pdf icon, I wish the report would be displayed in a new tab or sheet.  Currently, if I need to make a correction, I need to press on the back arrow.  But after I click on the back arrow, this action resets the drives and report screen to the point where I logged onto MileIQ instead to the point in the calendar where I was editing the mileage log.  This is a little frustrating to me.

I do not seem to spend enough time (which I believe is ~15 minutes from the help section) to seperate this drive from my short ~3 mile drive from the second store of the day to my home.  Is there anyway to fix this besides having to stop auto drive detection and log it manually all the time?  I appreciate your wisdom!  Thanks!!

I can't find an answer to this question. If I join two drives (trip + return trip) into a single round trip as described in the help docs, it seems I can no longer see any detail about the destination. For example, the roundtrip will simply say ""Home Office to Home Office"" and how many miles it was. I tried running a report to see if that would have details of the destination, but it didn't seem to.

Am I correct in thinking that joining two trips into a single round trip gets rid of the destination information? If so, is it better for reporting purposes to leave the two distinct trips intact so that the destination is preserved? Do most users work around this by writing the destination in the trip notes? This seems like more work, but necessary if you want a record of where you drove (which I believe is required). Am I missing something?

Here is what I mean by Tagging. Without knowing how the app sees how long i am at a location to accurately tag the stop for distance travelled and time that I arrived and departed is the ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù I was addressing.
As an electrician being able to tap a button to designate when I have arrived at a location and when I leave for both distance travelled and billing time on site.
I have seen that if my stop at a site is short enough that the app doesn‚Äôt recognize that stop and combines it with the next trip, I know that the app is only meant to record the mileage driven in the vehicle, but I am sure that I am not the only user who would find this function as a benifit.

201658,Amanda,1/1/18,vehicle management,"Could  Mile IQ fix the following problems: 

When I go back to classify my drives and I change the vehicle type on one leg of the trip for that day, MileIQ should  automatically change the vehicle for each leg of the trip to match. Currently the vehicle for each leg must be changed manually for that day. 

For example I don't leave the house in my Chevrolet truck and switch to My GMC Yukon at a remote location. Yet I have to change each trip leg to the right vehicle that I used. 

Also could your software be programmed to set the vehicle type for the trip automatically based on what Bluetooth interface my phone is connected to.  this would save a lot of work for persons with multiple vehicles.

I think it is unconscionable that Microsoft acquire Mile IQ, and there not be any ‚Äúplan‚Äù to release a version for Microsoft‚Äôs most loyal customers:  those who purchased and are still using Windows Phone.

I own two Windows Phones, and one Android.  I have had failed iPhones in the past as well.  In my experience, the Windows 10 Mobile OS is FAR superior to that of any other OS on the market.  This explains why I have not abandoned my Windows Phones, despite Microsoft‚Äôs decision to abandon the product.  I can probably speak for the thousands of others who, like me, are hopeful that the Windows Shell development will reignite Microsoft‚Äôs commitment to the Mobile market.

Please tell me that you are going to release a version of Mile IQ for Windows in the near future, because I am NOT going to move BACKWARD to an inferior OS.

203403,Amanda,1/1/18,start/stop,"Folks at MileIQ,
I just wanted to take a minute to reach out and share my thoughts as a new subscriber. I'm a big fan of everything the app does--it has made my life as a delivery driver tracking all my stops much, much easier. I do, however, have one suggestion, and since your site seems so welcoming of ideas and feedback, I thought I'd share.
The addition of a manual way to end a current drive would make this app even more of a home run. During my deliveries, my stops can be as little as a few minutes, and with the 15-minute(ish) window of drive-stop detection, it leads to me sitting around and waiting for the app to acknowledge my stop location. Adding a button in the app to ""end drive at current location,"" if possible, would save me time and ultimately make my business more profitable.
Don't worry about a response from support staff--simply add this idea to your list of user requests and I'll cross my fingers that this addition appears sometime soon :)

Quick questions.

 

I‚Äôm looking for an app that can :

 

1         Live track sales staffs location

2         Live track the location of hired in hauliers vehicles

3         Record business mileage for all car drivers who would like re-imbursement

4         Export the info to (A) our tracking system (Masternaut) via an API so that we can see the vehicles along with ours that are tracked by Masternaut in one system and (B) our admin systems.

 

You can do 3 and probably 4B.

 

You are tracking anyway ‚Äì any chance of 1, 2 and 4A ?

 

Cheers

It's great that we can scroll, hours, minutes, etc.  But while on my pc, my mouse covers the time if I click on the scroll up button to change the hours/minutes.  Difficult to see.

So occasionally I get in someone else's vehicle like a family member or friend and then the drive is detected.

206836,Amanda,1/1/18,edit drive details,"How do you classify a drive that is partially commute and partially business?

For mileage to be deductible, you must be driving or traveling for a work-related purpose. Visiting a client, picking up supplies or traveling for a conference are all valid reasons to claim mileage expense. However, the IRS specifically disallows employees and businesses to deduct the mileage involved in a normal commute to work. To account for this, you should subtract the amount of miles involved in your normal work commute from your reported mileage. For example, say that your home is a 10-mile round trip from your regular workplace. Instead of going to your regular workplace, you worked at a client site for one day, which was a 30-mile round-trip commute. The mileage incurred minus your normal commute -- 20 miles -- is reimbursable and deductible.

207068,Tiffany,1/1/18,mobile app functionality,"Two major flaws: 

If you are classifying and accidentally let one slip by as you flicked too fast, it's is not recoverable with a flick back. Fudge!!!

I find the user interface annoying to figure out and bifurcated and overly complicated. To the very point, people need a simple way to bill out a customer for the hours spent at the customers location for a given period, let's say one month for example. So you get total hours per location, total travel to, total travel from and total miles. We will bill at whatever that particular customer bills out as. There should be billing templates so I set up customer X once and it calculated it the same every time as a selected option.

There also should be a ""did you miss flag feature"" bringing back unclassified drives that accidentally got passed over.

208077,Kiara,1/1/18,customize drive sensitivity,"I would like to make a suggestion. Have MileIQ automatically detect when a drive is missing. For instance, when a phone dies in one location (Point A) and is not turned back on again until at another location (Point B). The gps tracking should recognize that the device has been moved since being turned off, therefore a prompt to the owner of the device could be made or the next time logging into the dashboard. The client could be given the option to accept the drive from Point A to B, edit Point A or B, add multiple stops between Points A and B, or delete the trip. I think this would eliminate many of the undetected drives that I have had over the last year. And ensure that my mileage is as accurate as possible.

 If our region is set to something like Canada, map and location suggestions should first start in Canada, preferably within a 200 KM radius.  ""No, I will not be driving to South Africa today, thank you for the suggestion though"" ahaha  Also, it'd be really nice to type in the name of the location (for example, Hornblower, Niagara Falls) and have the suggestions pop up.  I guess these suggestions are based on the limitations of the Bing maps API, but they'd be quite nice to have.   I suppose they aren't relevant once you start actually driving with GPS enabled.

Worth every drive! 
I understand things in life are not 100% accurate. Ever. I appreciate the app for the service it provides. This takes out hours and hours of work for me. Even though it misses a step because of gps location accuracy or anything else - I am consistently double checking my drives at night regardless. I have a two suggestions so far, please for the love of god let me put my times in for each drive (when I am manually adding a drive). I understand the website/app adjusts the time based on locations and distance, but distance and timing don‚Äôt match in LA ALOT because of traffic or other things let‚Äôs say. Even then the website/app only lets you adjust times in very weird quantities. I can only assume it‚Äôs on purpose - but either way it leaves my drive times inaccurate and it doesn‚Äôt look good to my bosses üò¨ Everything else about adding a drive in is perfect!  Second thing is that I would love to improve is the apps ability to show when I stop and start again from the same location. I have multiple drives from ‚Äúhome to home‚Äù that are almost two hr drives ... I drove to pick up someone and drive home. I stopped physically for more than 5min and at the end of that drive as well and it still didn‚Äôt pick up that my drive had ended and it needed to record a new one. This may be because of gps accuracy which is not great on iPhones per day. Otherwise this is probably the most amazing app Ive ever run into. This is a huge advantage compared to doing everything by hand. Thank you thank you thank you. Please let me help develop!!! I‚Äôm driving almost 5000 miles a month for personal and work - I would love to help improve things if it would help you guys. Otherwise thank you again!! Please keep up the hard work!

I‚Äôm sorry Im sending this in this fashion. Hopefully you guys can post this up for me!

209335,Amanda,1/1/18,start/stop,So far I have to say this app is by far the best I have used. The only thing I am missing is a way to end a trip . With me being an Uber driver when I drop off a passenger and then decide to go home I need some kind of a switch to split tracking as my drive from Passenger could at that point be a return trip home that I track is commute or just personal driving to do shopping. I know if I go around for a little bit of a walk then it sometimes splits the drives but how long do I wait before driving exactly or can I just shake my phone like crazy to make it think I'm walking and not driving to split the trips. The other reason I need this is for when I'm doing delivery orders. I want to know how much is going to pick up and how much is going to my drop off. Even a widget on the home screen or a button in the app just to click new drive to tell automatic tracking chip with a split in it.

Subject: Account Summary: No Drives Caught in January

 

January 2018

Hi punkinlee64,

Last month MileIQ caught no drives on your account. Because you‚Äôre a premium user we want to make sure you‚Äôre getting the most value out of your subscription as possible, which means making sure MileIQ is up and running properly.

Here are a few quick things to check if you've taken a drive but don't see it in your MileIQ account.

Are Location Services ""On"" for MileIQ?
You can verify your location settings:

* on iOS by going to: Settings > Privacy > Location Services > MileIQ > Always

* on Android by going to: Settings > Personal > Location > On

Is Background App Refresh/Data ""On"" for MileIQ?
You can verify your background refresh/data settings:

* on iOS go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh > MileIQ > On

* on Android go to Settings > Wireless & networks > Data usage > Cellular data > OnÔªø

Is MileIQ running?
The app doesn‚Äôt need to be open, but it does need to be running in the background, so don‚Äôt force quit the app. (And don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî this doesn‚Äôt cause additional drain on your battery.)

Is tracking active?
Make sure tracking isn‚Äôt paused in the app. You can resume tracking from Settings > Personalization > Drive Detection > Active

Is Wi-Fi on?
Even if you aren't connected to a hotspot, your phone uses them to register location information far more efficiently than GPS. You can turn on WiFi by going to your phone‚Äôs Settings > Wi-Fi > On.

If you answered yes to all of the above and you still think drives are still missing, please visit our drive detection best practices support page (https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.mileiq.com%2Flnk%2FAOUABCwuqqsAAAUAPjwAAAXwTXcAAAAIeOYAAAAAAAYDCgBadKazJINqCUcXSOmmUhCP1xWwngAFwjo%2F1%2Fr1JafBS1wBu-fabgoMEDtQ%2FaHR0cDovL3N1cHBvcnQubWlsZWlxLmNvbS9rbm93bGVkZ2ViYXNlL2FydGljbGVzLzQwNDIwOS1kcml2ZS1kZXRlY3Rpb24tYmVzdC1wcmFjdGljZXM&data=02%7C01%7C%7Cfdaae94bb83d4aab829a08d56a668719%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636531910940336078&sdata=kPaMTG0Oa9nh6lcuMgLt8elvqkq40Urll9zks3V7T0U%3D&reserved=0) , and if you still have questions, let us know.

214401,Alexis,2/1/18,start/stop,"Really like the app so far.  As an Uber driver, I can think a very useful feature that you could add:

The only issue I've found is that the auto-detect can only detect the end of a ride after a certain length of time has passed.  Driving for Uber, it's often stop-and-go, which doesn't present a problem most of the time.  But if, for example, I've  just dropped off my last ride and logged off for the day and head home,the app continues to log this as one big, long ""business"" ride. 

I'd like to see an option that would allow the user to end a trip and immediately swipe left or right.  E.g., I just dropped off my last ride and I'm heading home. I push a button on the screen marked ""Manually End Ride"".  The ride card appears, I swipe right to log it as a business ride.  The app still keeps tracking the miles. When I get home, I can swipe left to log the last miles travelled as personal.

I think many of your customers would find this a really useful feature and put you way ahead of the competition.  For sure, every ride-share user would pick your app over every one else's.  What do you say?

Thanks!

Need to have a start and end button on mobile device...I am losing records at times when there is no signal or GPS. Google Maps knows where I am, but apparently MileIQ does not.

A start and stop button will also help with those drives that are shorter, and if there is no signal.

in case you can't get GPS via satellite use google maps, most of the time my offline google maps works well in pinpointing my location, even offline.  

Prime example: I had feb 1 an appointment in athol, but the only leg of the trip that was recorded was from athol to winchendon, Gilbertville to athol - not recorded, winchendon to Gilbertville - not recorded.

Problem 2:
when trying to modify or add a leg of the trip,  determining the time is based of what was originally recorded. problem is the screen to add the new leg to the trip, covers the window so I can't see the time that was originally stated on the only leg that was recorded

I have a subscription with MileIQ with my Office 365 subscription.

 

I like the app ‚Äì but it creates work for me on the reporting.

 

Why doesn‚Äôt your XLS report have the Purpose of the trip as a column.  You have it in the PDF version but not the XLS.  The PDF print out doesn‚Äôt show all the cells and info is cut out.

 

If the XLS report would have the purpose column I wouldn‚Äôt be bothering you and not really liking the app.  I need that Colum in order to charge my mileage to the appropriate project.

* Right now I have to sit and create multiple pdf reports to do this.

* If the XLS report had that column then I could just send that report because my notes are there for accounting to charge the appropriate accounts and projects without me sitting wasting my time do extra work ‚Äì might as well go back to my spreadsheet days.  The same amount of time wasted.

 

 

Can you please add the purpose with notes columns to the XLS?

 

 

Talk Soon,

One of the issues that makes sorting trips on PC version of the site more difficult is that the ""checked boxes"" do not clear after selecting a categorization type.

I don't see any ""reset"" or ""uncheck all"" settings and it isn't happening automatically.

If you need any clarification, please let me know. Hope this can be improved so my tax time sorting is easier next year.

Can I start and stop a trip manually and classify it aftwards? It seems to be breaking up my trips in to smaller trips?  Annoying. 

I want to track and classify whole trips start to finish for business.  It shows up many smaller individual trips for some reason?

For instance when I drive Grubhub, their area is about 30-35 miles from my house. So I think the miles between my house and their area would be considered ""commute""!! But then when I get there, if I don't stop for a period of time the system just jumbles it all together. Another one is driving like Uber and switching over to Grubhub on the fly, again no break in miles in the system??

I suggest you guys figure out a way to actually let people who use your app to get the full benefit the 1st month out - you'll never get any upgrades if you just limit it always to 40 drives. I literally got 3 days with of data in the month of Jan and you only captured a weekend of driving in the month of Feb - which helps me ZERO with business. I only downloaded your app to help me remember where I'm going each day for work.


I don't get reimbursed for upgrading this so I will not do that, but if your only option is for me to go in and turn on Pause each time I don't want it to track - I wouldn't call that helpful at all. I'll just go back to logging all my own drives as this app doesn't help at all. If you wanted to help, allow us to set up locations in the app that we can automatically have deleted from the drives (ie local drives to and from in our own home town) that should seem obvious or weekends. I noticed in my settings it says ""add work hours"" into Saturday and sunday - but for some reason you're still holding those days against me and counting those for my 40 drives, when there is no work hours even added on those days - I only want work hours - how do I see only mon-fri? I know how to pause it now - which I find unproductive, but I'll do that as I'm at home office or picking my kids up from schools, etc.. You guys need to turn off weekends for me and or allow me to have one unlimited month to even see if it's what I want to do before paying you $60.


You should find a way to offer an app, maybe separate from this one for business only - that is what I'm using this for, someone like me doesn't need weekends or every drive captured - you should allow me to set it up the way I need to use it. Or give us a separate app to do so.

Why can't you see your recorded trips in the app?? Why do you have to go to a computer to see your classified trips?
Or at least make a clickable link that will take you to the website (now it just shows you the link but it is not clickable).

The problem with your auto classification is it doesnt matter whether the drive is 1 mile or 100 miles. If the destination and origin match it‚Äôs auto classified. How could these rides be considered the same?

This issue has rendered auto-classication as not only useless, but harmful to my accounting of business miles. I‚Äôve had to stop it altogether and review the last 14 months of rides.

The default is five minutes but I am generally at a stop way less than five mins, even less than three mins if the recipient answers the door quickly.
